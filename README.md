Network Resource Lookup Protocol

Drafted by Shulai Zhang

This project is aming to provide a way to help do inner-network resource search and fetch.

The protocol doc is not complete yet, since time is so limited.

I'm now working on the documentation. If anyone is interested in this. You can email me and discuss.
