Network Resource Lookup Protocol

Drafted by Shulai Zhang

This project is aming to provide a way to help do inner-network resource search and fetch.

The protocol doc is not complete yet, since time is so limited.

The below shows how to make the demo work.

1. get to the nodejs dir. Lauch two node scripts in bin file. These are two resource provider.
They are serving the pictures in nodejs.

2. get to the ngbf-t-nw dir. It lauches two program. One is the requester that you will do request on later,
another is animation that display the back-side logic on.

3. try "Cristiano" or "Koala" or "German" in the requester input and click the button. You shall see the animator displaying 
the whole process.

4. feel free to disconnect the serving provider and see how resumable downloading works.

I'm now working on the documentation. If anyone is interested in this. You can email me and discuss.
